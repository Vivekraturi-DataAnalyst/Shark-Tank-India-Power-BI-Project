# Project Overview

This project is an end to end Power BI dashboard analyzing all four seasons of **Shark Tank India**, created using a structured dataset sourced from Kaggle.
My goal was to explore funding patterns, investor behavior, industry performance, and founder demographics through a clean, interactive, and easy to understand report.

The dashboard includes:

* Dynamic KPIs
* Multi-page analysis
* Slicer-driven insights
* Professionally designed layouts
* Clean formatting
* DAX-powered logic for ranking, dynamic images, titles, and metrics

The dashboard is fully interactive, includes dynamic DAX calculations, clean navigation, and professional UI/UX design, making it ideal for portfolio demonstrations and analytics practice.

# Dataset Details

**Source:** Kaggle – Shark Tank India Dataset  

**Link:** *[Kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thirumani/shark-tank-india)*

The original dataset contained:

* Startup details
* Deal-related fields
* Sharks’ investment columns
* Pitcher demographics
* Industry information
* Multiple financial fields

However, the dataset was **not directly ready for analysis**.
Many fields were unnecessary, inconsistent, or required reshaping.
Hence, This dataset was cleaned, transformed and enhanced using:

✔ Power Query
✔ Excel
✔ DAX measures
✔ Custom logic to fix multiple problems

---

# Data Cleaning and Preparation

The raw Kaggle dataset contained 80 fields/columns and 630+ records.
I spent a good amount of time preparing the dataset to make it suitable for a clean Power BI dashboard.

### ✔ Key cleaning steps I performed:

* Removed **unwanted and irrelevant fields**
* Standardized **industry names, states, cities**
* Fixed **multiple rows per pitch issue** (same pitch spread across multiple rows)
* Used Power Query to **unpivot shark investment fields**
* Created a **shark-invested list column**
* Removed **duplicate entries**
* Converted financial columns to the correct data types
* Cleaned and categorized age groups
* Added gender categories (Male / Female / Mixed / Trans)
* Replaced blank values with proper nulls
* Ensured accurate **distinct pitch-level calculations**
* Cleaned deal-related fields to avoid inflated sums
* Fixed the “blank shark” deal problem
* Added extra helper tables (Metric Selector, Podium Table) for dynamic visuals
* Ensured smooth slicer interactions across pages

After cleaning, I prepared a structured version of the dataset suitable for multi-page reporting.
